# backronym-ninja

This project is a very simple React app / REST service that implements a backronym generator.

The backronym generator has one feature that other online generators lack: the ability to "pin" words that you like out of a randomly-generated backronym and re-roll the dice on the words that you don't.

The code is hosted live at http://backronym.ninja.
